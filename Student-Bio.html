      <p>Hello, I’m Samuel Cobb, and I am a Sophmore computer science student at Houghton University. I have a passion for computers and I have been involved in
         various programs and jobs throughout my life that reflect that passion. I have grown to be the ‘tech guy’ in my friend group, and I have always been available to help them with any questions or problems they may have. The experience that I have earned from that time has helped me to excel at my current work-study program as an IT specialist on campus. I am also involved in Houghton University’s Science Honors where we are currently using drones to study the environment around campus. During the Summer I am hoping to find an internship where I can have a meaningful impact on our nation's rapidly growing field of space exploration.
    </p>
