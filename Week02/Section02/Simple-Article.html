    Lewis Warner Green (January 28, 1806 – May 26, 1863) was an American Presbyterian minister, educator, and
    academic administrator. He was the president of Hampden–Sydney College, Transylvania University, and Centre
    College for various periods between 1849 and 1863. Born in Danville, Kentucky, baptized in Versailles, and
    educated in Woodford County, Green enrolled at Transylvania University but transferred to Centre College to
    complete his education. He graduated in 1824 as one of two members of the school's first graduating class. He
    enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1831 but returned to Kentucky in 1832 before graduating. After one
    year as a professor at Hanover College, he returned to Centre in 1839. He left again the next year for a position at
    Western Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, where he spent six years. He then went to Baltimore to preach
    full-time, though he resigned after just over a year and a half due to poor health.
