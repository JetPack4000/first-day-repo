        <h1>World News</h1>
        <p>
            News is information about current events. This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth,
            printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and
            witnesses to events. News is sometimes called <strong>hard news</strong> to differentiate it from soft media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subject matters for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, economy, business,
            fashion, sport, entertainment, and the environment, as well as quirky or unusual events.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Government proclamations</em>, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been
            dubbed news since ancient times.
