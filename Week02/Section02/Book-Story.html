        Castell Coch (Welsh for 'red castle'; Welsh pronunciation: <em>[ˈkas.tɛɬ koːχ])</em> is a 19th-century Gothic Revival
        castle built above the village of Tongwynlais, Cardiff, in Wales. The first castle on the site was built by the
        Normans after 1081 to protect the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the River Taff.
        Abandoned shortly afterwards, the castle's earth motte was reused by <em>Gilbert de Clare</em> as the basis for a new
        stone fortification, which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands. This
        castle may have been destroyed in the native Welsh rebellion of 1314. In 1760, the castle ruins were acquired by
        John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, as part of a marriage settlement that brought the family vast estates in South
        Wales.

        John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute inherited the castle in 1848. One of Britain's wealthiest men, with
        interests in architecture and antiquarian studies, he employed the architect William Burges to rebuild the
        castle, <q>as a country residence for occasional occupation in the summer</q>, using the medieval remains as a basis
        for the design.
